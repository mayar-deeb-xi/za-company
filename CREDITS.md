## Top-down character, dungeon tileset, jar

- License: **CC0 1.0 Universal** (public domain) - no attribution required, commercial use permitted
- Files: `game/player/character.png`, `assets/tiles/dungeon.png`, `assets/props/jar/jar.png`
- Editable Aseprite sources kept alongside in `game/player/src/`, `assets/props/jar/src/` and `assets/tiles/src/`
- `game/player/character.png` is a **restyle** of that sheet, not the original:
  black curly hair, fair skin, grey shirt, blue jeans. The untouched CC0 sheet is
  kept at `game/player/src/character_cc0.png`; `tools/build_character_sheet.gd`
  regenerates the restyled version from it.
- The marble and hellfire tilesets are derived from `dungeon.png`: floor and
  wall tiles are palette-swapped copies of it (see `tools/build_biomes.gd`).
  CC0 permits this without restriction. The columns and door arches in those
  same files are original work, not derived from the sheet.
